    </div>

    <p class="padded-top">We're very excited to announce the Cambridge University Light
    Entertainment Society's (remote) Easter term productions: "In The Nick Of Time" - a comedy radioplay
    by Grace Beckett and Henry Weighill, and "Nothing To See Here" - a sketch show featuring sketches 
    by Gregory Miller, Anna Trowby and Ido Rosen.</p>
    
    <p>After a very brief hiatus, CULES is making a grand (albeit rather poorly 
        timed) return. Though we are in uncertain and unprecedented times, 
        CULES will always strive to bring a smile to your face and provide fun, silly 
        comedy theatre where it is most needed. This Easter term, we will be raising money for
        <a href="https://www.trusselltrust.org/">The Trussell Trust</a>, a charity battling
        hunger and poverty throughout the UK. Though our radio shows will be totally free to access, 
        we invite you to donate whatever you can to our <a href="https://www.givey.com/comedyshowsforthetrusselltrust">
        fundraiser. Anything is appreciated!</a></p>

        <h4 class="margin-top--none">7pm, 8 June on Cam FM</h4>
        <p>What happens when four World War II Bletchley Park codebreakers are accidentally transported into the 
        21st century? Bravery, valiance and indefatigable courage abounds? Not likely! Follow this hapless foursome 
        as they navigate the perils of the modern world, encountering everything from malicious train conductors 
        to aged professors on a whirlwind adventure through the Home Counties! But with Britain’s entire war effort 
        at stake, will they make it back before it’s too late?</p>

        <p>Have you ever fancied listening to a sketch show? If so, now’s your time.  Yes, you can listen to a sketch 
            show which follows every twitch and flutter of the brain, moving from Vacuum cleaners to bananas, haunted 
            hotels to suspect sandwich makers, from a strange dating app to an even stranger fashion editor. But you’ll 
            never see any of it. Then again, you don’t need to. The soundwaves will paint vivid pictures in your mind, 
            pictures so vivid that you won’t be able to get them out of your mind. Even when you dream, you’ll dream 
            of sandwiches, bananas and all other forms of witty shenanigans. Now, do we know for certain that this 
            will happen? No. Is it based on any evidence at all? No. But here’s one thing that can be promised. This 
            show will be wacky, and it will feature all the above things mentioned. Make of that what you will.</p>

        <h1>About CULES</h1>

        <div class="pullout">
            <p>Are our dramatics amateur beyond belief? Yes. Was the last Varsity match called a draw due to a lack of line learning? Yes.</p>
            <cite><a href="http://www.tcs.cam.ac.uk/features/0033823-student-spotlight-the-cambridge-university-light-entertainment-society.html">Sam Raby, The Cambridge Student</a></cite>
        </div>

        <p>We're a student-run group who bring theatre (normally daft theatre) to those who don't normally get the chance to see it, like special needs schools and retirement homes. We also do public shows to raise money for various charities.</p>
        <p>We generally perform a play and a pantomime in both Michaelmas and Lent. In Easter we perform four short plays around a theme (designed to be manageable and relaxing for after exams!). All of these are written, directed and produced by members of the society, often first-timers.</p>
        <p>We also just like hanging out with each other. We go see shows put on by our sister society in Oxford, <a href="http://oules.lightentertainment.org/">OULES</a>, and they come to see us. We usually have a camping trip to somewhere with forests or mountains in the summer, and a three-day-long New Year's party together. Some of us head up to the Edinburgh Fringe in August to do a more professional show (also normally daft), with things like actual theatres, budgets, sometimes even rehearsals.</p>

        <h2 id="join">How to get involved</h2>
        <p>Just come along to our friendly open auditions at the beginning of each term, details of which get posted here and on our <a href="/mailing-lists.htm">mailing lists</a>. Even if you've never done anything like this before, we'd still like to see you! We have many parts with varying levels of commitment available, so if you don't want to take on too much, or if you want to steal the show, just let us know.</p>
        
        <p>If you'd like to be next term's shows, or just ask us about stuff, <a href="mailto:soc-cules-committee@lists.cam.ac.uk">drop us an email</a>.</p>
